As with many fantastic things in life, this one starts with a strong woman.

My mother, Maggie Samantha Knapp, affectionately known as Mags or MaggieMom, is my ultimate inspiration for my rooftop garden project and all attempts (past and present) at growing plants. 

The vast majority of my mom’s professional life as a horticulturist was spent as the Head Gardener at Jenkins Arboretum outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; where I grew up and my deep love of nature and plants flourished. To say my mom connects with plants on another level is an understatement. In a 2011 Philadelphia Inquirer profile piece on my mom, they perfectly capture her essence in a direct quote: “I identify with plants. They can’t fake it. They are \[alive] and they matter.”

My mom’s approach to plant care is equal parts nurturer and guardian. From a young age, I recall her immediate response if I picked leaves off a shrub or a petals off a flower while meandering around the yard. “How would you like it if someone came and ripped some hair out of your head or pulled your arm off your body?” 

Okay, maybe the message is a bit extreme, but in theory she was totally right. (And plus, I’m sure I was picking leaves and flowers off of plants she had spent months, if not years, patiently tending. I’d be PO’d too.) 

At the risk of sounding incredibly corny, I was blessed to grow up where I did: in a green, lush slice of paradise conveniently located outside a major city. My backyard abutted the arboretum’s perimeter, with our backyard as a continuation of the intentional outdoor design and cultivation of Jenkins. I grew up with a vegetable garden in my yard and herbs grown from sunny pots along stone walls outside. Some of my favorite childhood memories are of my mom yelling out to me, though our open screen door (I was usually already playing outside) to go pick some lettuce for a salad or basil for some pesto. Tearing across our yard barefoot, I’d grab a few handfuls, always taste testing along the way (quality control!) In my pre-teens, the garden expanded to include a sweet new feature: beehives, of which we’d be the lucky recipient of honey.

The secret sauce for plant growth is a multifaceted mix of soil, sun, water, and nutrients⁠—throw off any one of those elements and, well…results may vary. Luckily for the gardens where I grew up, my mom always added her own special ingredients to great effect. Fearlessness, tenderness, and pure physical strength colored every movement of my mother’s work.

Wielding chainsaws to dissect downed trees, working patiently with volunteers to sort and plant bulbs, throwing bags of soil and mulch over her shoulder to tuck cozily into springtime garden beds. Leading educational workshops on pruning practices. Reading garden stories to a circle of young, enraptured arboretum visitors. Easing tree roots into dug holes the size of a refrigerator. Listing the Latin and common names of plants like recalling the name of a next door neighbor. 

These labors of love and expertise weave together my mom’s legacy, marked by plant lives grown, saved and nurtured.

I like to think that I’ve absorbed some of my mom’s knowledge and tips for outdoor gardening in my 30 years of life. Until I decided to start this project, I’ve been attempting to grow “beginner friendly” plants indoors; again, with mixed results. I can only hope that I make her proud with my latest attempt at growing plants. And, maybe if I’m lucky, I can ask her to go outside and pick some lettuce for a salad the next time my parents are in town.
